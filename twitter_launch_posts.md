### **Problem/Pain Point Posts** (7 days before)

**Post 1:**
```
I'm SO tired of this...

*works on personal project at home*
*gets to office*
*Cursor looks completely different*
*terminal shortcuts don't work*
*dotfiles are missing*

WHY is syncing configs still this painful in 2025? 😤

Anyone else living this nightmare?
```

**Post 2:**
```
Real talk: I've wasted HOURS of my life doing this...

✋ Manually copying VS Code settings between machines
✋ Recreating my perfect terminal setup from scratch
✋ Losing custom aliases and shortcuts
✋ Having different Git configs break my workflow

There HAS to be a better way... right? 😔
```

**Post 3:**
```
Me: *writes beautiful code at home*
Me: *gets to work*
Code: *looks like garbage*

Oh right... different formatter settings.
Oh right... different linter rules.
Oh right... different EVERYTHING.

How is syncing configs still so broken? 🤦‍♂️
```

### **Feature Teasers** (5-6 days before)

**Post 4:**
```
What if I told you there's a way to keep ALL your development configs in perfect sync across every machine you own? 🤔

Native GUI ✅
Works with ANY cloud storage ✅
Smart conflict resolution ✅
Cross-platform ✅

Something big is coming... 👀

I might have found a solution to our config nightmare...
```

**Post 5:**
```
Sneak peek at what I've been building 👀

🔄 Smart bidirectional sync
📁 Computer-specific paths
👁️ Visual diff viewer
💾 Automatic backups
🛡️ Conflict resolution

One tool to rule all your configs across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Launch week approaches... 🚀

Been working on this for months. Finally ready to share.
```

**Post 6:**
```
Demo time! 🎬

Watch how easy it becomes to sync your configs:
1️⃣ Drop the tool in your cloud folder
2️⃣ Configure your paths once
3️⃣ Smart sync handles the rest

No complex setup. No vendor lock-in. Just works.

Full reveal coming soon! 

This might actually solve our config sync problem...
```

### **Technical/Behind-the-Scenes** (3-4 days before)

**Post 7:**
```
Let me share the tech stack I chose for this project! 🛠️

I built this with:
🟢 Go for performance & cross-platform support
🎨 Fyne for native GUI experience  
☁️ Cloud-agnostic design (works with ANY storage provider)
📦 Single executable, zero dependencies

I wanted performance to meet simplicity, and I think I nailed it.
```

**Post 8:**
```
Why I chose to make this cloud-agnostic 🌩️

❌ No vendor lock-in
❌ No monthly subscriptions  
❌ No privacy concerns
✅ Use YOUR existing cloud storage
✅ Full control of your data
✅ Works with Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.

I believe your data should be your choice. 🔐
```

**Post 9:**
```
The biggest technical challenge I faced: handling file conflicts intelligently 🧠

My solution:
🕐 Timestamp-based smart sync
👀 Visual diff viewer
💾 Automatic backups before changes
🤝 Merge assistance for conflicts

Because losing work is NOT an option.
```

### **Tips & Tricks** 

**Post 28:**
```
💡 Pro tip: Computer-specific paths

Set different paths for each machine:

Work laptop: `/home/user/.config/`
Personal desktop: `/home/username/.config/`  
Windows PC: `C:\Users\username\AppData\`

Same configs, perfect paths everywhere! 
```

**Post 29:**
```
💡 Pro tip: Backup strategy

Config Sync Tool automatically creates backups, but here's the pro move:

1️⃣ Enable backup before sync
2️⃣ Set backup retention policy

Safety first, always! 🛡️
