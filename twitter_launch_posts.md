**Morning Post:**
```
I'm SO tired of this...

*works on personal project at home*
*gets to office*
*Cursor looks completely different*
*terminal shortcuts don't work*
*dotfiles are missing*

WHY is syncing configs still this painful in 2025? 😤

Anyone else living this nightmare?

**Evening Post:**
```
Real talk: I've wasted HOURS of my life doing this...

✋ Manually copying VS Code settings between machines

✋ Losing custom aliases and shortcuts
✋ Having different Git configs break my workflow

There HAS to be a better way... right? 😔
